Overview

AnimationDataMaker was created for the purpose of creating animation data for characters and other items used in developing PlayStation game software. Although it was created for PlayStation, it can also be used with DirectX.

It reads the data created in the game and the images used for animation and runs them according to the program.

By using this, you can eliminate the trouble of having to manually create data, for example when creating an animation of a character running.

File format

When you save, two files will be created: an .ADP file and a .SPA file. These two files make up one set.

.ADP file
Information for editing is stored. You can delete it if you do not need to edit it.

.SPA file
This is the data group actually used in the animation. Details are shown below.

*u_long = unsigned long
u_short = unsigned short
u_char = unsigned char
