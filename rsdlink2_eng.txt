【 overview 】
　・RSD file, which is 3D object data for PlayStation artists
　　Converts it into 3D object data for programmers.
　・The <rsdlink> included with "Net Yarouze" can only convert up to about 5,000 polygons.
　　In this program it is effectively infinite.
　- As with <rsdlink>, there is no limit to the number of RSD files that can be linked.
　・This program does not have the following features like <rsdlink>.
　　　1. Scale calculation
　　　2. Translation calculation
　　　3. Displaying object information
　　　4. Polygon information display
　By specifying the <-o> option, the group specified in the GRP file is treated as an object.
　　You can output it as a
　　For example, if three groups are defined in one GRP file, they will be treated as one object.
　　Create three objects.

[How to use]
　-rsdlink [options] RSD file name ...
　　　[option]
　　　　-o TMD file name :
　　　　　・Specify the output file name.
　　　　　- The default output file name is <a.tmd>.
　　　　-g :
　　　　　- Export the group as an object.
　　　　-p filename :
　　　　　-Primitive information is output to a separate file.
　　　　-v filename :
　　　　　- Vertex information is output to a separate file.
　　　　-n filename :
　　　　　- Vertex and normal information is output to a separate file.
　※Note
　　- Please enter the output file name including the file extension.
　　　The input file name is optional.
　　・There is no particular extension for <filename> in <-p><-v><-n>.
　　　Please make your own.
　　　The file name cannot be omitted.

[Issues]
　・When using the <-g> option or increasing the number of polygons, processing becomes extremely slow.

[Future Plans]
　I'll update it if any problems arise.

【history】
　2000/8/12: First distribution
　2000/8/16: The vertex data calculation was incorrect, so it was corrected.
　2000/8/18 : Added <-g> option
　2000/8/21: Fixed the issue where temp files were not deleted.
　2000/9/20 : Added <-p><-v><-n> options
