【 overview 】
　- RSD file, which is 3D object data for PlayStation artists
　　Combines overlapping parts of vertex and normal data into one.
　-If there are overlapping parts, the data will expand.
　　It is also used to eliminate this.
　- Supports long file names.

[How to use]
　・RsdPack [options] Input file name
　　　[option]
　　　　-cv :
　　　　　- Only duplicate vertex data is merged.
　　　　-cn :
　　　　　- Only duplicate normal data will be merged.
　　　　-f <filename> :
　　　　　・Specify the output file name.
　　　　　- The default output file name is <a.rsd>.
　　　　-p :
　　　　　- Only PLY files are output.
　　　　　If you specify <-f>, enter the RSD file name as the output file name.
　　　　　・The input file can be overwritten only when this option is specified.
　　　*Please enter the input and output file names including the extensions.
　・Example ①RsdPack test.rsd
　　　　　　Vertices and normals are combined and output as <a.rsd><a.ply><a.mat><a.grp>.
　　　　②RsdPack -f b.rsd test.rsd
　　　　　　Vertices and normals are combined and output as <b.rsd><b.ply><b.mat><b.grp>.
　　　　③RsdPack -p -f b.rsd test.rsd
　　　　　　Vertices and normals are combined and output as <b.ply>.
　　　　④RsdPack -cv test.rsd
　　　　　　The vertices are collected and output as <a.rsd><a.ply><a.mat><a.grp>.
　　　　⑤RsdPack -cn test.rsd
　　　　　　The normals are collected and output as <a.rsd><a.ply><a.mat><a.grp>.

[Issues]
　I haven't done much debugging so there may be some strange parts.
